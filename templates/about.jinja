	<p>MBTA Trips is a Python-powered webapp which displays, for each MBTA route in Boston, the number of currently active MBTA trips and the average trip duration over a typical day. Ideally, this information can be used as proxies for when the subway system is busiest. I always wondered "how many vehicles are actually running", so I decided to build this app to answer that question.</p>
